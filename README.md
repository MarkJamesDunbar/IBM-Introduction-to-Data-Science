## Machine Learning Capstone Project:
    London - one of the busiest cities in Europe - attracts a large number of tourists and students, 
    not least due to its vibrant city life and diverse culture. One of the many challenges visitors 
    face can be finding the right place to eat - be it for dietary/religious reasons, or simply personal 
    preference.

    Through this project I want to be able to provide a simple guide for visitors in London: 
    o In what parts of the city are you likely to find your desired restaurant? 
    o Where's best to eat Mediterranean food? 
    o Where to find Indian food or even Japanese food? 

    This project will ultimately take a look at how we can use Python, pandas, webscraping and some machine 
    learning tools to take a look at what various City of London Boroughs have to offer.
